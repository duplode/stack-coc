## Scope

This repo is explicitly an unofficial part of the Stack community. An
official policy would need to be approved by the full Stack team. Such
a policy could then have enforcement that includes excluding people
from repositories, mailing lists, and other official community
resources. I will not conceit to make such decisions unilaterally.

My goal here is different. I am trying to establish some accepted
standards for behavior of the Stack community in general. I am hoping
for this to be broader than just official communication channels. I'm
going to encourage improved communications across all mediums.

But I have no right to demand this of anyone, especially in general
communications. Therefore this repository serves primarily to document
how I believe people should act in the Stack community.

As I have done in the past, I will be available for people to
privately express concerns about the behaviors of others, in keeping
with the CoC. And while I will not make unilateral decisions on behalf
of the Stack leadership, I will, as necessary:

* Reach out privately to request changes in behavior
* Publicly request changes in behavior
* Raise the issue with the rest of the Stack leadership and consider a
  more official response
