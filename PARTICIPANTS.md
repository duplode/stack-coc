# Participants

This file contains a list of people who have in some way agreed to
participate in following the recommendations in this repository. I'm
not certain this file is a good idea, but I'm including it as a point
of discussion, and to see if others join in.

Since the recommendations here will change over time, you are welcome
to either put your name down as signing onto any future changes, or
providing a specific Git commit to which you've reviewed and agree.
